I decided to let newbies to spring-boot learn about authentication using firebase.

You will learn the following:

1. How to configure the spring boot app to speak to firebase in SecurityConfig class
2. How to run Firebase.Initialization on startup of the application.
3. How to change curl commands to code in the java backend.
4. Adding users, authentication e.t.c

Hope you will have a productive, happy coding!
